I. INTRODUCTION

Finding a place at a top-performing primary school is notoriously tricky, and catchment areas around the most popular options are often tiny. Many families move house in the hope of getting their children into a particular school. But for parents who want to minimise the risk, a more sensible option is to pick an area where all the schools are good with a house they can afford. 

*Catchment area is the area that a school serves is determined by the admission criteria and where the children who are admitted come from. The area that children come from changes from year to year depending on the applications received.*
