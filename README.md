I. INTRODUCTION

Finding a place at a top-performing primary school is notoriously tricky, and catchment areas around the most popular options are often tiny. Many families move house in the hope of getting their children into a particular school. But for parents who want to minimise the risk, a more sensible option is to pick an area where all the schools are good with a house they can afford. 

*Catchment area is the area that a school serves is determined by the admission criteria and where the children who are admitted come from. The area that children come from changes from year to year depending on the applications received.*

IV. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION

Central London, South West, South East and North London are all quite different.

Central London has fewer pupils at the reception class, higher percentage of free school meals and percentage of pupils achieving higher than average scores is lower compared to other parts of London, with the exception of City of London borough (which is not representative as only one school is present in the data).

South West London looks quite good, as median percentage of pupils achieving high grades is high, it looks quite mixed as median percentage of pupils with English not being the first language is higher than in South East of London. There are not many schools compared to North London. This could be a good area for family to move when it is time to start school.

Segmenting councils could be next step to understand better areas of London in terms of schools. Also it would be helpful to add other stats, for example house prices, crime statistics, venues statistics.
